# Deploying-a-model-to-production-using-Flask

The Deep Learning models can be deployed to production by converting them into REST API's and hosting them as local host using Flask !

Once the model is trained and weights of it are saved, we can convert them as a REST API to serve the predictions when hosted in the localhost.

VGG16 is model is used for training the cats and dogs images and the predictions are served as the web application.
